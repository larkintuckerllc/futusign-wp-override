Description
===


A plugin that adds support for overriding media, for example to temporarily override media on subscribed playlists, to the [futusign](https://github.com/larkintuckerllc/futusign-wordpress) digital signage management software.

Installation
====

The latest plugin is available for download from the *release* tab.

Upload and activate the plugin via the WordPress Plugins admin screen.

Usage
====

Like playlists, you subscribe screens to overrides and add media, e.g., images, to them.

If any of a screen's subscribed overrides has media on it,  the screen player will play the media from the overrides instead of those on the playlists.

**Tips**

* The primary usage of this feature is to temporarily (scheduling / expiring) content into an override list.
* Like playlists, a screen can subscribe to multiple overrides; allows for flexible targeting of screens.
